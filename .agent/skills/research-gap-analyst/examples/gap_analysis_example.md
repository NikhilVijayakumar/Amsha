## Critical Gaps (Must Address)

### 1. Missing Baseline Comparisons for Evaluation Algorithm
**Finding:** The weighted scoring algorithm in `output_process/evaluator.py` is implemented but not compared against standard grading methods.

**Location:** `src/nikhil/amsha/output_process/evaluator.py:L23-L55`

**Impact:** Reviewers cannot assess whether the weighted approach provides advantages over simpler methods. This weakens the novelty claim.

**Recommendation:**
1. Implement 3 baseline methods:
   - Simple arithmetic mean
   - Median-based grading
   - Standard normal curve
2. Run comparative benchmarks on test dataset
3. Perform statistical significance testing (t-test)
4. Add results table to paper

**Estimated Effort:** 4-5 hours

---

### 2. Hardcoded Hyperparameters Without Justification
**Finding:** Multiple magic numbers found without documentation:
- `threshold = 0.75` in `evaluator.py:L42`
- `weight_decay = 0.001` in `optimizer.py:L18`
- `batch_size = 32` in `processor.py:L65`

**Location:** Multiple files (see above)

**Impact:** Cannot justify parameter choices to reviewers. Lacks scientific rigor.

**Recommendation:**
1. Move all constants to Pydantic configuration models
2. Add docstring explaining rationale for each default
3. Conduct sensitivity analysis (±20% variation)
4. Document findings in methodology section

**Estimated Effort:** 6 hours

---

### 3. No Reproducibility Guarantees
**Finding:** Random operations without seed specification:
- Data shuffling in `repository.py:L103`
- Sample selection in `evaluator.py:L78`

**Location:** 
- `src/nikhil/amsha/crew_forge/repository.py:L103`
- `src/nikhil/amsha/output_process/evaluator.py:L78`

**Impact:** Results may vary across runs. Violates reproducibility requirement.

**Recommendation:**
1. Add `RANDOM_SEED = 42` constant
2. Use `random.seed(RANDOM_SEED)` before all random operations
3. Document seed value in methods section
4. Add note about reproducibility in README

**Estimated Effort:** 2 hours

---

## Moderate Gaps (Should Address)

### 4. Limited Performance Metrics
**Finding:** Only execution time is currently measured. Missing:
- Memory usage profiling
- CPU/GPU utilization tracking
- Accuracy metrics (if applicable)
- Scalability analysis

**Location:** `src/nikhil/amsha/crew_monitor/monitor.py`

**Impact:** Incomplete performance characterization limits comparison with other systems.

**Recommendation:**
1. Add `psutil` for CPU/memory tracking
2. Add `py3nvml` for GPU metrics (if applicable)
3. Implement scalability tests (N → 2N, 4N)
4. Create performance comparison table

**Estimated Effort:** 5-6 hours

---

### 5. Missing Literature Comparison
**Finding:** No explicit comparison to related orchestration frameworks:
- LangChain Agents
- AutoGPT
- Semantic Kernel
- CrewAI (baseline)

**Location:** Documentation/Paper draft

**Impact:** Cannot demonstrate novelty or unique contributions clearly.

**Recommendation:**
1. Add "Related Work" section to paper
2. Create comparison table (features, performance, architecture)
3. Highlight key differences (repository pattern, clean architecture)
4. Benchmark against LangChain if feasible

**Estimated Effort:** 8-10 hours (includes research)

---

### 6. Incomplete Test Coverage for Edge Cases
**Finding:** Unit tests exist but missing edge cases:
- Empty input handling
- Maximum boundary values
- Concurrent access scenarios
- Error propagation chains

**Location:** `tests/unit/` directories

**Impact:** May have undiscovered bugs that surface during review or production.

**Recommendation:**
1. Add edge case tests using `pytest.mark.parametrize`
2. Test boundary conditions (0, MAX_INT, empty lists)
3. Add concurrent access tests using `threading`
4. Target ≥90% branch coverage

**Estimated Effort:** 6-8 hours

---

## Minor Gaps (Nice to Have)

### 7. No Ablation Study
**Finding:** Weighted scoring uses multiple components but no study showing contribution of each.

**Recommendation:** Ablation study removing one weight at a time to show each component's impact.

**Estimated Effort:** 4 hours

---

### 8. Limited Visualization of Architecture
**Finding:** Only basic diagrams in documentation. Could benefit from:
- Sequence diagrams for key workflows
- State diagrams for task lifecycle
- Performance graphs

**Recommendation:** Add Mermaid diagrams for 3+ key workflows.

**Estimated Effort:** 3 hours

---

## Summary

**Total Gaps Identified:** 8

| Severity | Count | Status |
|:---------|:-----:|:------:|
| Critical | 3 | ❌ Must fix |
| Moderate | 3 | ⚠️ Should fix |
| Minor | 2 | ✅ Optional |

**Total Estimated Effort:** 34-42 hours

**Priority Order:**
1. Reproducibility (2h) - Quick win
2. Hyperparameters (6h) - Medium priority
3. Baseline comparisons (5h) - High impact
4. Literature review (10h) - Time-consuming but essential
5. Performance metrics (6h)
6. Edge case tests (7h)
7. Ablation study (4h) - If time permits
8. Visualizations (3h) - If time permits
