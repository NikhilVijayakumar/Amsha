# The master blueprint simulation (usually this comes from DB, but AtomicCrewDBManager 
# expects THIS dictionary to act as the job request, while it fetches blueprint from DBService.
# Wait, AtomicCrewDBManager calls `self.blueprint_service.get_config(name, usecase)`.
# So I need to MOCK the DB Service or ensure the DB Service can read from somewhere?
# The AtomicCrewDBManager uses `CrewForgeContainer.crew_blueprint_service()`.
# If I want NO mocks, I should use `FileCrewOrchestrator` which reads from YAML files directly!
# The user asked for "new package example... test each module with an example".
# Using `FileCrewOrchestrator` is "no mock" in the sense that it uses real files.
# `DbCrewOrchestrator` requires a real DB or a mock DB service.
# I will use `FileCrewOrchestrator` for the integration demo as it is self-contained.

# So this job_config will be adapted for FileCrewOrchestrator.
# FileCrewOrchestrator expects a config that points to YAML files.
