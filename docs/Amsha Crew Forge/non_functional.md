### 1. Introduction

This document defines the non-functional requirements (NFRs) for the **Amsha Crew Forge** library. While the Functional Requirements document specifies *what* the system does, this document specifies *how well* the system performs its functions. These NFRs outline the quality attributes, operational constraints, and standards the library must adhere to.

### 2. Non-Functional Requirements

#### 2.1 Performance

-   **NFR-PERF-01: Synchronization Throughput:** The library is designed for build-time or deployment-time operations, not real-time use. It must be capable of synchronizing a repository of at least 100 configuration files (e.g., 50 agents, 50 tasks) in under 15 seconds on a standard developer machine, excluding network latency to the database.
-   **NFR-PERF-02: Resource Consumption:** The library must be lightweight. The memory and CPU usage during a synchronization process should be minimal and scale efficiently with the number of files being processed. It should not introduce significant overhead to the consuming application's build process.

-----

#### 2.2 Reliability

-   **NFR-REL-01: Graceful Error Handling:** The library must gracefully handle predictable errors (e.g., malformed YAML, invalid file paths, database connection issues) without crashing. It should provide clear error messages to the user.
-   **NFR-REL-02: Data Integrity:** In the event of an unrecoverable error during the synchronization of a single 'use case', the system must prevent partial or corrupt data states. Changes for a failed use case should not be committed to the database.
-   **NFR-REL-03: Informative Logging:** All significant operations, warnings, and errors must be logged with sufficient detail to enable effective debugging without requiring inspection of the source code.

-----

#### 2.3 Usability (Developer Experience)

-   **NFR-USE-01: API Simplicity:** The public API presented to the developer must be simple, intuitive, and well-documented. A developer should be able to integrate and use the library with minimal boilerplate code.
-   **NFR-USE-02: Clear Documentation:** The library must be accompanied by comprehensive documentation that includes:
    * A quick-start guide.
    * Clear usage examples.
    * A complete API reference.
-   **NFR-USE-03: Straightforward Configuration:** The process for configuring the library (e.g., providing database credentials, file paths) must be simple and flexible, achievable through a configuration object or environment variables.

-----

#### 2.4 Security

-   **NFR-SEC-01: No Secret Storage:** The library's code and its in-memory processes must not store or log sensitive information such as passwords, API keys, or full database connection strings.
-   **NFR-SEC-02: Secure Dependencies:** The library must only depend on well-maintained packages from trusted public repositories (e.g., PyPI). It should be periodically scanned for known vulnerabilities in its dependency tree.

-----

#### 2.5 Maintainability

-   **NFR-MAIN-01: Code Readability:** The source code must be clean, well-structured, and adhere to standard Python coding conventions (PEP 8) to facilitate contributions and long-term maintenance.
-   **NFR-MAIN-02: Modularity:** The codebase must be highly modular, enforcing a clear separation of concerns (e.g., repository interfaces, service logic, utilities). This is to ensure that changes in one part of the system have minimal impact on others.
-   **NFR-MAIN-03: Test Coverage:** The core synchronization and business logic of the library must have a high level of automated unit test coverage (target > 80%) to ensure stability and prevent regressions.

-----

#### 2.6 Compatibility

-   **NFR-COMP-01: Python Version Support:** The library must be compatible with Python 3.12 and all subsequent minor versions.
-   **NFR-COMP-02: Platform Independence:** The library must be operating system agnostic and function correctly on Windows, macOS, and Linux environments.
