### 1. Introduction

This document provides the technical specification for the **Amsha Crew Forge** library. It is intended for software developers who will be building, maintaining, or contributing to the library. This document outlines the technology stack, architectural design, data models, and patterns chosen to fulfill the requirements specified in the Functional and Non-Functional Requirements documents.

-----

### 2. Technology Stack

-   **TR-TECH-01: Language:** The library will be developed in **Python 3.12** or higher, as per `NFR-COMP-01`.
-   **TR-TECH-02: Core Dependencies:**
    * **Pydantic:** To be used for all data modeling, validation, and settings management. This enforces strict data contracts and provides robust validation.
    * **PyYAML:** To be used for safely parsing the YAML configuration files.
-   **TR-TECH-03: Initial Database Adapter:** The initial release will provide a concrete repository implementation for **MongoDB**, using the `pymongo` library.
-   **TR-TECH-04: Testing Framework:**
    * **pytest:** The primary framework for writing and executing all tests.
    * **pytest-cov:** For measuring code coverage to ensure test quality as per `NFR-MAIN-03`.

### 3. Architectural Design

The library will be built using a layered, modular architecture to ensure maintainability, testability, and extensibility.

#### 3.1. High-Level Architecture

The architecture will follow the principles of Clean Architecture, separating concerns into distinct layers:

1.  **Service Layer:** Contains the high-level business logic and orchestration (e.g., `ConfigSyncService`). This layer is the primary public interface for the library.
2.  **Repository Interface Layer:** Defines the abstract contracts (`IAgentRepository`, `ITaskRepository`, etc.) for data persistence. This layer decouples the Service Layer from the Data Layer.
3.  **Data Adapter Layer:** Contains the concrete implementations of the repository interfaces for specific databases (e.g., `MongoAgentRepository`).

#### 3.2. Core Components

-   **Repository Interfaces (`interfaces.py`):** A set of abstract base classes using Python's `abc` module that define the methods for CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations.
-   **Repository Implementations (e.g., `mongo/`):** Concrete classes that inherit from the repository interfaces and contain the database-specific logic (e.g., `pymongo` calls).
-   **`ConfigSyncService`:** The public-facing class that orchestrates the synchronization process. It will be initialized with concrete repository instances via dependency injection.
-   **`DatabaseSeeder`:** An internal worker class, used by the `ConfigSyncService`, that contains the core logic for file system traversal, YAML parsing, and state comparison.
-   **Pydantic Models:** A set of data models defining the structure of Agents, Tasks, and Crews.

#### 3.3. Design Patterns

-   **TR-ARCH-01: Adapter Pattern:** The repository layer will implement the Adapter pattern to fulfill `FR-EXT-01`. Each database-specific repository class (e.g., `MongoAgentRepository`) will act as an adapter that conforms to the `IAgentRepository` interface.
-   **TR-ARCH-02: Repository Pattern:** Data access logic will be fully encapsulated within repository classes, separating persistence concerns from the core application logic.
-   **TR-ARCH-03: Dependency Injection:** Services (`ConfigSyncService`) will receive their dependencies (repository instances) through their constructor (`__init__`). This decouples components and is critical for enabling unit testing with mocks or fakes.

### 4. Data Models

-   **TR-DATA-01: Data Validation with Pydantic:** All data transfer objects (DTOs) representing agents, tasks, and crews will be implemented as Pydantic `BaseModel` classes. This provides automatic data validation, type enforcement, and clear documentation of data structures.
-   **TR-DATA-02: Request and Response Models:** To maintain clear data flow contracts, separate `Request` and `Response` models will be used. For example, an `AgentRequest` model will be used for creating an agent, while an `AgentResponse` model, which includes the database `_id`, will be used for representing a retrieved agent.

-----

### 5. Error Handling and Logging

-   **TR-ERR-01: Exception Strategy:**
    * Predictable errors (e.g., invalid configuration) may be represented by custom exception classes (e.g., `ConfigurationError`).
    * Standard Python exceptions (`ValueError`, `FileNotFoundError`) will be used where appropriate.
    * Database-specific exceptions (e.g., `pymongo.errors.ConnectionFailure`) will be caught and handled within the specific data adapter, which may re-raise them as more generic, library-specific exceptions.
-   **TR-ERR-02: Logging Implementation:**
    * The standard Python `logging` module will be used for all logging.
    * The library will obtain a logger instance (e.g., `logging.getLogger(__name__)`) and will **not** configure the root logger. This allows the consuming application full control over log handling, formatting, and destination.

-----

### 6. Testing Strategy

-   **TR-TEST-01: Unit Tests:** Unit tests, written with `pytest`, will target individual components in isolation. The core logic in the `DatabaseSeeder` and `ConfigSyncService` will be tested by injecting mock or in-memory fake repository implementations, removing any dependency on a live database.
-   **TR-TEST-02: Integration Tests:** A separate suite of integration tests will be developed to validate the interaction between the services and a live database instance (e.g., a Dockerized MongoDB container). These tests will focus on verifying the correctness of the `Mongo...Repository` adapter implementations.
-   **TR-TEST-03: Code Coverage:** As specified in `NFR-MAIN-03`, code coverage will be measured using `pytest-cov`, with a target of **>80%** for all core logic modules.
