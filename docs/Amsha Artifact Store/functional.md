### 1. Introduction

This document specifies the functional requirements for the **Amsha Artifact Store**. This module is a utility designed exclusively to provide a local file-system-based caching service. Its purpose is to enhance the performance of other Amsha modules (like the Linter and Forge) by avoiding the redundant execution of expensive operations on unchanged source data.

-----

### 2. Core Problem Statement

High-level development tools, especially those in CI/CD pipelines, are executed frequently. Running expensive operations—such as NLP analysis or database queries—on every execution is inefficient and slow, particularly when the underlying source data has not changed.

> **Amsha Artifact Store** aims to solve this problem by providing a robust, content-based caching framework to eliminate this redundant work.

-----

### 3. Goals and Scope

#### 3.1. Goals

-   To significantly improve the performance of Amsha tools by implementing a content-based caching mechanism.
-   To provide a simple and consistent API for caching and retrieving the results of expensive operations.
-   To allow client applications to enable or disable this caching behavior as needed.

#### 3.2. Scope

The scope of this module is strictly limited to providing a local file-system-based cache and the logic to manage it. The default location for this cache will be an `.amsha/` directory within the client project.

-----

### 4. Core Features (Functional Requirements)

#### 4.1. Caching Functionality (`FR-AS-CACHE`)

-   **FR-AS-CACHE-01: Content-Based Caching:** The system shall provide a mechanism to store and retrieve the results of an operation using a key derived from a hash of the operation's input content.
-   **FR-AS-CACHE-02: Cache Validation:** The system must provide a function to check if a valid cache entry exists for a given content hash.
-   **FR-AS-CACHE-03: Cache Operations:** The system must provide internal functions to get and set cache entries within its designated file-system location.
-   **FR-AS-CACHE-04: Configurable Caching:** The system shall allow the caching feature to be programmatically enabled or disabled for specific services that use it (e.g., `Amsha Crew Forge`).

-----

### 5. User Roles and Personas

-   **AI/Application Developer:** Configures the Artifact Store, primarily by enabling or disabling the caching feature for specific tools like the `Amsha Crew Forge`.

-----

### 6. Assumptions and Dependencies

-   The library has the necessary file system permissions to create and write to an `.amsha/` directory within the client project's root folder.

-----

### 7. Out of Scope

-   **Artifact Persistence:** The library will **not** provide any functionality for storing final artifacts like reports or logs. The responsibility for saving these files lies entirely with the client application.
-   **Pluggable Storage Backends:** The library will **not** provide an interface or support for any storage backend other than the default local file system cache (i.e., no support for cloud storage).
-   **Custom Storage Solutions:** The library will **not** provide a framework for creating custom storage solutions. It is a cache manager only.
