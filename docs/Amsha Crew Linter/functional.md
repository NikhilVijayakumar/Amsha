### 1. Introduction

This document specifies the functional requirements for the **Amsha Crew Linter**. The Linter is a static analysis tool designed to programmatically validate the quality, cohesion, and alignment of CrewAI component definitions. By analyzing an agent's definition, its assigned task, and the governing business requirement, the Linter provides automated feedback on the design quality of the crew before it is ever executed.

The intended audience includes software architects and the AI/Application developers who will use this library to enforce quality and consistency in their agentic systems.

### 2. Core Problem Statement

The effectiveness of a CrewAI agent is highly dependent on the quality and alignment of its prompt-based definitions (role, goal, backstory, task description). Manually reviewing these natural language artifacts is subjective, time-consuming, and does not scale. This leads to several challenges:

-   **Component Mismatch:** An agent's defined goal may not be well-suited for its assigned task, leading to poor performance.
-   **Requirement Drift:** The implemented agent and task may not fully or accurately reflect the original business requirement.
-   **Logical Errors:** A task's description might contain illogical or circular steps that are hard to spot manually.
-   **Lack of Standards:** There is no automated way to enforce prompt engineering best practices or consistency across a team or project.

> **Amsha Crew Linter** aims to solve these problems by providing a fast, automated, and objective framework for validating agent and task definitions against each other and against a formal requirement.

### 3. Goals and Scope

#### 3.1. Goals

-   To provide an automated framework for the static analysis of CrewAI component definitions.
-   To improve the reliability and predictability of AI agents by catching design-time errors.
-   To enforce alignment between the business requirement, the agent's purpose, and the task's execution plan.
-   To enable the integration of prompt quality checks into standard CI/CD pipelines.

#### 3.2. Scope

The scope is strictly limited to the analysis of the provided definitions (agent, task, requirement). It is a static analysis tool; it does not involve executing the crew or evaluating the live output from an LLM.

### 4. Core Features (Functional Requirements)

#### 4.1. Input and Execution (`FR-LINT-IN`)

-   **FR-LINT-IN-01: Component Inputs:** The system shall accept three primary inputs for a single linting operation: an agent definition, a task definition, and a requirement definition.
-   **FR-LINT-IN-02: Pluggable Guardrails:** The system must be designed to execute a collection of validation rules (Guardrails). The specific set of guardrails to be executed, along with their configurations (e.g., thresholds), shall be provided by the client application at runtime.

#### 4.2. Validation Checks (`FR-LINT-VC`)

-   **FR-LINT-VC-01: Agent-Task Synergy Validation:** The system shall be capable of validating the semantic alignment between an agent's definition (e.g., its `goal`) and its corresponding task's definition (e.g., its `description`).
-   **FR-LINT-VC-02: Requirement-to-Component Validation:** The system shall be capable of validating that both the agent and task definitions are semantically aligned with and cover the scope of the provided requirement.
-   **FR-LINT-VC-03: Procedural Validation:** The system shall provide a mechanism to analyze and validate the logical sequence of steps described within a text (e.g., an agent's goal or task description), including checks for logical gaps or cycles.

#### 4.3. Reporting (`FR-LINT-RP`)

-   **FR-LINT-RP-01: Structured Report Output:** Upon completion of all checks, the system must produce a single, structured, machine-readable report object summarizing the results.
-   **FR-LINT-RP-02: Comprehensive Report Details:** The report must contain:
    * An overall validation status (e.g., PASS/FAIL).
    * A detailed result from each individual guardrail that was executed.
    * Actionable, human-readable messages for each result.
    * Rich metadata for traceability, including timestamps and the input data that was tested.

#### 4.4. Operational Constraints (`FR-LINT-OP`)

-   **FR-LINT-OP-01: Stateless Operation:** The Linter library must be entirely stateless and not persist any data between invocations.
-   **FR-LINT-OP-02: Abstract Dependencies:** The Linter's core logic must depend on abstract interfaces (e.g., `IGuardrail`), not on concrete implementations, allowing for maximum flexibility.

-----

### 5. User Roles and Personas

-   **AI/Application Developer:** The primary user who will integrate the Linter into their development workflow or CI/CD pipeline to automatically validate their CrewAI definitions.

-----

### 6. Assumptions and Dependencies

-   The client application is responsible for loading all data (agent, task, requirement definitions) and providing it to the Linter.
-   The client application is responsible for instantiating and configuring the specific guardrail objects that will be used for validation.

-----

### 7. Out of Scope

-   **Runtime Evaluation:** The Linter will not execute any crews or make calls to generative LLMs to evaluate their output.
-   **Providing Guardrails:** The Linter *orchestrates* guardrails. While the library may ship with a default set of guardrails, its core design allows users to create and inject their own custom guardrails.
-   **Report Storage:** The Linter produces a report object in memory. It is the responsibility of the client application to persist this report (e.g., save to a file, send to an API).
