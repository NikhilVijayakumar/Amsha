  "scientific_concept": "Quantum Entanglement",
  "core_concept": "Quantum entanglement is a special connection between two or more particles that lets them affect each other even when they're really far apart. Imagine you have two toy cars, and you connect them with a magic spring. If you push one car, the other car will move too, even if it's on the other side of the room! This is kind of like what happens with entangled particles.",
