  name: "Generate Scientific Knowledge Base"
  description: |
                Acts as a science educator and curriculum designer for children. It takes a single, high-level scientific concept and expands it into a detailed, purely factual, and structured JSON object. This document is designed to serve as the foundational "ground truth" for all future creative tasks.
            
                Input:
                - scientific_concept : {scientific_concept}
            
                Steps:
                1.  Receive the scientific_concept as input.
                2.  Define a simple, age-appropriate summary of the concept.
                3.  Identify the Key Components and "Actors" (e.g., "Sun," "Water," "CO2," "Chlorophyll") and write a brief description for each.
                4.  Outline the "How it Works" as a logical, step-by-step process.
                5.  Explain the "Why it Matters" (its importance to the ecosystem or daily life).
                6.  List the Core Scientific Principles this process demonstrates (e.g., "Energy Transformation," "Chemical Reaction").
                7.  List relevant, age-appropriate vocabulary.
                8.  Assemble all information into a single, structured JSON object as defined in the expected_output.

                      A single, structured, and valid JSON object.

They use three main ingredients: sunlight (from the sun), water (from the ground), and a gas you can't see (called carbon dioxide, which is what we breathe out). They mix these ingredients inside their leaves to make a type of sugar (their food) and, as a wonderful gift, they release the air that we need to breathe (called oxygen).",
